## 📂 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Spotify's track-level data** using SQL. The dataset includes various audio features like energy, danceability, liveness, tempo, and more, along with popularity scores.

Using structured queries, the project answers several business and musical questions such as:

* Which songs and artists are most popular?
* What is the correlation between energy and danceability?
* What characteristics define hit songs?

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* Writing advanced **SQL queries**
* Using **GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, **ORDER BY**, and **JOINs**
* Performing **data aggregation** and **ranking**
* Using **window functions** (if applicable)
* Translating business questions into analytical queries

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

Here are some of the analyses done in the project:

* 🔝 Top 10 Most Popular Songs
* 👨‍🎤 Top Artists with the Highest Average Popularity
* 💃 Songs with High Energy and Danceability
* 💤 Least Popular Songs by Audio Features
* 🎶 Genre-wise Distribution and Track Count
* 🧪 Energy-to-Liveness Ratios

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **SQL** (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
* **DBMS**: pgAdmin / MySQL Workbench
* **Git & GitHub** for version control

## 📌 How to Run

1. Import the dataset (`spotify_data.csv` or similar) into your SQL database.
2. Open `spotify_queries.sql` in your SQL editor.
3. Run queries step by step to explore the data.
4. (Optional) Export results for visualization in Power BI / Tableau / Excel.

## 🖼️ Sample Insights

Here are a few insights discovered:

* 🎧 Songs with both **high energy (> 0.8)** and **high danceability (> 0.8)** tend to have **popularity scores above 70**.
* 🎤 Artists like **Ed Sheeran** and **The Weeknd** consistently appear in top rankings.
* 💤 Songs with high liveness often have **lower popularity** compared to more studio-produced tracks.
